Data analysis efficiency can be greatly increased by creating an application that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt-based interactions to perform statistical analysis on CSV files. Users will be able to import and display data more easily thanks to this program, which will make it easier to read and parse CSV files. In order to provide a thorough understanding of the dataset, it will carry out fundamental statistical analysis, such as determining the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient. The program will also produce a variety of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, and histograms, which provide visual aids for data interpretation. Users with little programming knowledge can nevertheless interact with the application intuitively by utilising the power of LLM for prompt-based instructions. With the help of this technology, data analysis operations may be streamlined, making statistical analysis easier.
